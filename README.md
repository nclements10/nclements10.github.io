# Public Website

This public website was built from the Agency Jekyll Theme as linked [here](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme). I fully intend on editing this theme to better suit my needs and perhaps phase its use out as I learn more about web development. However, for the time being, this is a good platform for me to get started with building my personal website.
